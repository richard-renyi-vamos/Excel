create an excel formula that checks if a cell is "N/A" or some other value. 
IF it equals "N/A" then it copies another cell
IF it is NOT "N/A" then it copies that cell

You can use the IF function in Excel to achieve this. Here's the formula:

excel
Copy code
=IF(A1="N/A", B1, A1)
Explanation:

A1 is the cell you want to check if it equals "N/A".
If A1 equals "N/A", the formula will return the value of B1.
If A1 does not equal "N/A", the formula will return the value of A1.
You can replace A1 and B1 with the actual cell references you're working with. This formula should be entered into the cell where you want the result to appear.

modify it so it checks for "N/A" OR "n.n."

Sure! You can use the OR function along with the IF function to check for multiple conditions. Here's the modified formula:

excel
Copy code
=IF(OR(A1="N/A", A1="n.n."), B1, A1)
Explanation:

The OR function checks if any of the specified conditions are true.
If A1 equals "N/A" or "n.n.", the formula will return the value of B1.
If A1 does not equal "N/A" or "n.n.", the formula will return the value of A1.
Again, replace A1 and B1 with the actual cell references you're working with. This formula should be entered into the cell where you want the result to appear.
