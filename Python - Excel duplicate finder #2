import pandas as pd

# read the first Excel file
df1 = pd.read_excel('file1.xlsx')

# read the second Excel file
df2 = pd.read_excel('file2.xlsx')

# merge the two dataframes and find the duplicates
duplicates = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='inner')

# output the duplicates to a new Excel file
duplicates.to_excel('duplicates.xlsx', index=False)

# In this script, we first use the pd.read_excel() function to read in the two Excel files as Pandas dataframes (df1 and df2). 
# We then merge the two dataframes using the pd.merge() function and specifying how='inner' to find the rows that appear in both dataframes (i.e., the duplicates). 
# Finally, we use the to_excel() function to output the duplicates to a new Excel file named duplicates.xlsx, without including the index column. 
# You can adjust the file names and paths as necessary for your specific use case.
