create an EXCEL MACRO that deletes cells with selected keywords

Sure, here's a simple Excel macro that deletes cells containing specific keywords:

vba
Copy code
Sub DeleteCellsByKeywords()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim deleteKeywords() As String
    Dim keyword As Variant
    Dim cellValue As String
    
    ' Define your list of keywords to search for
    deleteKeywords = Array("keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3") ' Add or remove keywords as needed
    
    ' Specify the range to search within
    Set rng = ActiveSheet.UsedRange ' Change to a specific range if needed
    
    ' Loop through each cell in the range
    For Each cell In rng
        cellValue = cell.Value
        ' Loop through each keyword
        For Each keyword In deleteKeywords
            ' Check if the keyword is found in the cell value
            If InStr(1, cellValue, keyword, vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
                ' Delete the cell if a keyword is found
                cell.ClearContents
                Exit For ' Exit the loop after deleting the cell
            End If
        Next keyword
    Next cell
End Sub
Here's how it works:

Replace "keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3" with the keywords you want to search for.
Specify the range where you want to search for keywords. In the code, it's set to ActiveSheet.UsedRange, which searches through all used cells on the active sheet.
Run the macro. It will loop through each cell in the specified range and delete the cell if it contains any of the specified keywords.
Remember to save your workbook as a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm) if it's not already saved in that format. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“Š
