You can efficiently select the 120 customers you need by using Excel's built-in functionality like VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Open both lists: Have your list of 350 customers in one Excel sheet and the list of 120 customers you need in another.

Ensure a Unique Identifier: Make sure there's a unique identifier in both lists, like a customer ID or name, that you can use to match the records.

Add a Helper Column (if needed): If the lists don't have a common identifier, you may need to add a helper column to one or both lists to create one. For instance, you could add a column where you concatenate the first and last names.

Use VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH: In a new column next to your list of 120 customers, use either VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH to check if each customer is in the list of 350. Here's how:

VLOOKUP: Assuming your list of 120 customers starts in cell A2 and your list of 350 customers is in columns A:B (with customer names in column A and other info in column B), in cell B2 of the list of 120 customers, use the formula:

less
Copy code
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, '350 Customer List'!A:B, 2, FALSE), "")
Drag this formula down for all 120 customers. This will return the corresponding info from the list of 350 customers if a match is found, or an empty cell if not.

INDEX-MATCH: If you prefer INDEX-MATCH, the formula would look like this:

less
Copy code
=IFERROR(INDEX('350 Customer List'!B:B, MATCH(A2, '350 Customer List'!A:A, 0)), "")
Filter or Sort: Once you have the results, you can filter or sort the helper column to easily see which customers from the list of 350 are also in the list of 120.

Copy or Extract: After identifying the matching customers, you can copy them to a new sheet or extract them in any way you need for further analysis or processing.

Using these methods, you can efficiently select the 120 customers you need from your list of 350 in Excel! Let me know if you need further assistance with any of the steps. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“Š
