create an EXCEL formula that checks if a value is included in a specified range.
if YES then it should show the value.
if NO then it should stay blank

Sure, you can achieve this using the IF and COUNTIF functions in Excel. Here's the formula:

excel
Copy code
=IF(COUNTIF(range, value)>0, value, "")
Replace range with the specified range where you want to check if the value is included, and value with the value you want to check for.

For example, if you want to check if the value in cell A1 is included in the range B1:B10, the formula would be:

excel
Copy code
=IF(COUNTIF(B1:B10, A1)>0, A1, "")
This formula will return the value if it's found in the specified range, otherwise it will return a blank cell.
